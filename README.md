# E-Shop Project
An e-shop website, developed with the Spring MVC Framework on a WildFly server, in a 2-man team. I handled the entire Front-End part, including CSS/JavaScript Animations, Responsive Design, AJAX Requests with JQuery, navigation through Controllers, and other visual tricks such as Carousels, Sliders, Testimonials, Parallax.
